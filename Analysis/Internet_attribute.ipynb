This result could be of interest to educators and policymakers looking to understand the impact of digital resources on student learning outcomes.\n",

    "However, it's crucial to approach one-tailed tests with caution and ensure they're justified based on prior evidence or a strong theoretical rationale, as they inherently involve testing for an effect in a predetermined direction. The result here underscores the potential value of internet access as a resource for academic support, particularly in math, suggesting that efforts to increase internet accessibility might positively impact student performance.\n",
