## Hypothesis-Testing-Educational-Report

Prepared a report of my analysis results using A/B testing, focusing on several attributes that affect the final grade G3 of students. This **Comprehensive report**, presents an extensive analysis utilizing a variety of statistical tests, including ANOVA, Tukey's HSD post-hoc test, t-tests, Welch's t-test, Levene's test for equality of variances, and both Pearson and Spearman correlation tests. The focus of this investigation was to ascertain the effects of study time, parental education, school absences, school support, and internet access on students' final grades (G3).

Through detailed analysis, I have derived key insights and underscored the importance of designing and implementing targeted interventions. These interventions, tailored to meet the unique needs and conditions of students, are imperative for advancing educational equity and expanding access to critical resources. The outcomes of this report highlight the critical role of a nurturing home environment, the importance of regular engagement with educational activities, and the vital importance of accessible educational technologies in the realm of modern education.
